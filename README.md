## Description
Lightweight application for forcing the timer resolution and for cleaning the standby list & the working set with a custom hotkey for Windows. It stores the settings in registry in the following path "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Memory Cleaner\Settings". The desired timer resolution is measured in microseconds divided by 10, so for example 0.5ms equals 5000 and 1ms equals 10000. Settings get applied after closing the Settings tab. If nothing pops up after clicking "Check for updates", it means that there's no updated version available.
