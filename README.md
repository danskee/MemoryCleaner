## Description
An application that displays your current available amount of RAM and your current timer resolution in milliseconds, lets you set a custom timer resolution and clear the standby list and the working sets with a custom hotkey combo. It stores the settings in registry in the following path "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Memory Cleaner\Settings". The desired timer resolution is measured in microseconds divided by 10, so for example 0.5ms equals 5000 and 1ms equals 10000.
